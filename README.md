There are still biases against minorities when it comes to the hiring world. According to HBR, “Since 1990 white applicants received, on average, 36% more callbacks than black applicants and 24% more callbacks than Latino applicants with identical résumés.” People shouldn’t miss out on job opportunities because of the way they look or sound.

Everybody has some sort of bias, when they hear or see certain people. But what if the recruiters and interviewers couldn’t see, hear or identify the participants? We built an interview system that eliminates most biases in the hiring process, and the candidates’ identities are only revealed towards the end of the hiring process. 

(Start playing tutorial) When the applicant enters their data and their resume, and hits submit, their application goes through our service. We keep personal information of the candidate, and the recruiters only see their qualifications and their experience. All identifying factors are stripped out of their application to remove bias, and the candidate moves forward to the next stage of the interview. 

During the interview, the interviewer and the interviewee would be placed in different rooms and the audio would be manipulated so the identification by voice would not be possible.

This kind of interview process will eliminate most of the biases in the process. All the data would be released for background check when the candidates are towards the last stage of interview process where they must see the candidate b4 hiring.
